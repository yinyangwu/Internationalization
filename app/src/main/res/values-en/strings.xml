    <string name="test_text">When you are sending messages with specific delivery options, use platform-specific fields to set them. You can specify different values per platform if you want. However, even when you want to set essentially the same value across platforms, you must use platform-specific fields. This is because each platform may interpret the value slightly differently—for example, time-to-live is set on Android as an expiration time in seconds, while on iOS it is set as an expiration date.</string>
